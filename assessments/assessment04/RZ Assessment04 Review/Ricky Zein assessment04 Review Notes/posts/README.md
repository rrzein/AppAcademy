# Assessment 4

This assessment will focus on a simple CRUD app with authentication.

You will have to model users, posts, and tags, along with session
management.

The specs all test high-level functionality in your app. Take a look at
them as you go to ensure you are naming your links, buttons, and routes
correctly.

Good luck!
