# Assessment00a Instructions

This assessment consists of four problems to complete in one hour. The
assessment is meant to challenge you somewhat. Do not worry if you do
not complete all the assessment; do the best you can.

The instructions for the practice problems are written inside the spec
files (in the `spec` directory); check those for instructions on what
you are supposed to do. You can run the specs for an individual
problem like so:

    rake spec spec/00_digital_root_spec.rb

You can write your code in the corresponding files in `lib` (e.g.,
`lib/00_digital_root.rb`). I've filled them out with a blank method
for you. You'll need to write the code to make the specs pass.

Work through the problems one by one; when you complete writing the
code, run the spec to check your work. Make sure to look at the
results it returns; look at which individual tests fail and then start
to figure out why.

Finally, submit your solution by submitting a ZIPed copy of the
assessment folder (including both specs and lib). Attach this on the
form at:
