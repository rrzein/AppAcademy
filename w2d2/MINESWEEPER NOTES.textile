Minesweeper notes

-Broken down into Tile, Board, and Minesweeper classes
-Alias_method to rename to a question_mark/boolean-resulting accessor
-Recursive explore method
-Dont even need to initialize an instance variable neighbors
	-The base case is if the square is flagged or explored
	-Ultimately returns self

	def explore
	return self if flagged?
	return self if explored?

	@explored = true
	if (not bombed?) && adjacent_bomb_count == 0
		neighbors.each { |adj_tile| adj_tile.explore }
		end

		end

		self
	end

-What does inspect do in the solution?
-In addition to "rendering" when you explore, there's a "reveal" when you lose
