# App Academy Work

This repo contains all of my learnings and projects completed during my time as a student at App Academy, save for my final two capstone projects.

## Selected Works

#### Versa and inlike
Versa and inlike are my final two capstone projects for App Academy, both built on a Backbone.js/Ruby on Rails. You can find the repos for the two projects below:
  * [Versa](http://github.com/rrzein/versa)
  * [inlike](http://github.com/rrzein/inlike)

#### Snake
Snake was my first foray into heavy object-oriented design in JavaScript and building browser-based games.
  * [Snake](https://github.com/rrzein/appacademy/tree/master/w6d3/snake)

#### ActiveRecord "Lite" and Rails "Lite"
During weeks 4 and 5 respectively, I built custom, "lite" versions of ActiveRecord and Rails to solidify my understanding of how ORM's and web frameworks function.
