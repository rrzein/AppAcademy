SQL Intro

Breaking down domain into database is important because it forces you to ask what your application essentially needs to function.

Three things needed:
-The tables you will have
-The columns each of those tables will have
-The data type of each of those columns

Static Typing
-In SQL you need to specify the type of data that will go into each column

Data type note: BLOB stores binary data

Modeling Relationships
Foreign key - A value in a database table that points to a row in a different table
	-Foreign key in one table will reference the primary key in another table
	-Column that houses foreign key is *other_table_name_singularized_*id
-Foreign keys ensure that data is not duplicated across databases
-Datase normalization - Databases should limit the amount of duplicated data across tables

Structured Query Language (SQL)
SQL - domain-specific programming language that queries data out of relational databases

Queries broken down into CLAUSES.

SELECT - list of comma-separated column names
FROM - table name
WHERE - list of conditions separated by AND or OR

4 Main Data Manipulation Operations:
-SELECT - retrieve values from one or more rows
-INSERT - insert a row
-UPDATE - update values in one or more existing rows
-DELETE - delete one or more rows

INSERT -> inserting a row

CREATE TABLE - specify name of table, then in parentheses, the column names along with their data types

DATABASE CONSTRAINTS - must be specified. 

JOIN - joins together two tables.
ON - specify how those tables relate to one another.
